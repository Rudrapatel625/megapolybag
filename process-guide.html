<h1>Our Manufacturing Process</h1>

<p>
At Mega Polybag, we follow a systematic and controlled manufacturing
process to ensure consistent quality, strength, and durability in
PP Woven and BOPP Laminated Bags.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Raw Material Selection</h2>
<p>
We use high-quality virgin and approved polymer granules suitable for
industrial and food-grade packaging.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Tape Extrusion & Weaving</h2>
<p>
PP tapes are extruded and woven into strong fabric using modern looms.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Lamination & Printing</h2>
<p>
BOPP lamination and flexographic printing are done for moisture protection
and brand visibility.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Cutting & Stitching</h2>
<p>
Bags are cut, stitched, and finished as per customer specifications.
</p>

<h2>Step 5: Quality Check & Dispatch</h2>
<p>
Final inspection ensures load strength, printing clarity, and packaging
accuracy before dispatch.
